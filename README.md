# randomtalegen
I wrote this small tool to generate an audio file containing random samples of 1s and 0s.

You will have to add ffmpeg to this directory for it to work properly which can be downloaded from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
Add your samples in a directory 1 and 0 respectively for your recorded samples.
